EmuArduExample
==============

 This directory contains a single file EmuArduExample.ino (the classical blink program)
that can be loaded in Arduino IDE and compiled for real arduino but also for
"Arduino Uno Emulation" platform declared by EmuArdu (see EmuArdu project for how
to declare this platform), and launched via "EmuArdu Launcher"
programmer.

 In this later case, the program will launch on your computer, as a picture showing the Arduino
and squares and each data pin showing its state

Installation/Requirements
=========================

see EmuArdu project

The Eclipse way
===============

 You can use the Eclipse CDT plugin to compile this project from Eclipse.
 It contains references to the EmuArdu one (the 2 projects must be imported in same eclipse workspace)

 "Compile" and "Run" buttons should work directly.
